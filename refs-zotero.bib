Finding common environments is important in such situations, to demonstrate that the error does arise, reproducibly, but also to share with the author the exact environment so that the issue can be fixed. Shipping around laptops probably isn't the right solution. We illustrate how we addressed some of those cases using container technology throughout this post.},

We study this question in modern US data using a structural VAR model of 10 monthly frequency variables, identified by heteroskedasticity. Negative reduced-form responses of output to credit growth are caused by endogenous monetary policy response to credit expansion shocks. On average, credit and output growth remain positively associated. ``Financial stress'' shocks to credit spreads cause declines in output and credit levels. Neither credit aggregates nor spreads provide much advance warning of the 2008\textendash 2009 crisis, but spreads improve within-crisis forecasts. (JEL C51, E23, E31, E43, E44, E52, G01)},

Tales are executable research objects that capture the code, data, and environment along with narrative and workflow information needed to re-create computational results from scientific studies. Creating reproducible research objects that enable reproducibility, transparency, and re-execution for computational experiments requiring significant compute resources or utilizing massive data is an especially challenging open problem. We describe opportunities, challenges, and solutions to facilitating reproducibility for data- and compute-intensive research, that we call "Tales at Scale," using the Whole Tale computing platform. We highlight challenges and solutions in frontend responsiveness needs, gaps in current middleware design and implementation, network restrictions, containerization, and data access. Finally, we discuss challenges in packaging computational experiment implementations for portable data-intensive Tales and outline future work.},

Recent studies suggest, however, that sharing code and data does not suffice for computational reproducibility \textemdash defined as the ability of researchers to reproduce ``par- ticular analysis outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software'' (Fidler and Wilcox, 2018). To date, creating long-term computationally reproducible code has been technically challenging and time-consuming. This tutorial introduces Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform that attempts to solve these problems. It does this by adapting software engineering tools, such as Docker, for easier use by scientists and scientific audiences. In this article, we first outline arguments for the importance of computational reproducibility, as well as some reasons why this is a nontrivial problem for researchers. We then provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with containers in research using Code Ocean. (Disclaimer: the authors all worked for Code Ocean at the time of this article's writing.)},

Moreover, trust companies connected to ``money trust'' banks maintained higher valuation than independents and rebounded much faster. The desire to prevent panic from spreading from infected trusts to financial institutions in his purview could explain Morgan's rapid intervention to stem the contagion.},

For cities with higher initial pollution levels, subway openings reduce particulates by 4~percent in the area surrounding a city center. The effect decays with distance to city center and persists over the longest time horizon that we can measure with our data, about four years. For highly polluted cities, we estimate that a new subway system provides an external mortality benefit of about \$1 billion per year. For less polluted cities, the effect is indistinguishable from zero. Back of the envelope cost estimates suggest that reduced mortality due to lower air pollution offsets a substantial share of the construction costs of subways.
